# Angiography Image Pairs for Correspondence Matching

We will publish papers about evaluation results soon.

## Dataset Information

This repository shares selected frames from the original "Angiographic dataset for stenosis detection", which consists of coronary angiography cine images.
The dataset provides pairs of images of the same vessel from the same patient, but taken at different angles, to evaluate correspondence matching in coronary angiography images. 
The pair information was constructed by a skilled radiographer.
